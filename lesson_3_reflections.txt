*When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	-when I want to share with others

*Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-I can decide when I want to pull my commits and to what branch

*Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-forks: between 2 repositories in GITHUB(copy)
	clones: between 2 repositories in GITHUB and local or local and local(copy)
	branches: in local in 1 repository

*What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	-to be able to decide if you to merge

*How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	-it would be easier to just put files in any share location without all of this
	but it would be harder to follow and manipulate changes from me and other

*When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	-when make changes in master it has less complicated but doesn't save a pure version
	but in make changes in seperate branch we save original version and can try features and onther approches for our project although it is more complicated
